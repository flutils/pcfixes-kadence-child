# ðŸ”¥ Kadence Child Theme
### System through which a Kadence-backed Wordpress site can be populated with content, plugins, CPT's, sections and users via a JSON file.

PCFixes' Kadence child theme gives us the ability to define various amounts of content and have them imported into the theme in a systemic way.

The benefit is that it makes the process of deploying Wordpress websites systematic, allowing for various designs/payloads to be distributed throughout a network of sites without having to customise them in intricate ways.
