# Kadence Child Theme
### Interface through which a Kadence-backed Wordpress site can be populated with content, plugins, CPT's, sections and users via a JSON file.

It is designed to help replicate instances of Kadence based websites by using JSON files to populate their content etc. The aim is to make a "framework" which can be adapted to suit different environments.
