# Kadence Child Theme
### Standardized interface through which a Kadence-backed website can be populated with content, CPT's, sections and users via a JSON file

This is designed to provide a means to duplicate/replicate Kadence based websites by using JSON files to populate content etc. This particular part of the system needs to provide the structure for said JSON files to populate.
