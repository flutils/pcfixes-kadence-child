// RPECK 02/07/2023 - Thematic Framework
// Extension to the "Kadence" theme which overrides render hooks and gives us the means to manage templates via the allocation of "sections"

/* -- NOTES -- */

// RPECK 16/07/2023 - Folder Name
// The original folder name was meant to be "kadence-child-theme"
// Unfortunately, this caused a conflict with how redux framework was identifying if a file was present in a theme 
// --
// The problem was that file class-redux-functions-ex.php line 393 was testing whether the directory structure of a file was present in a theme
// If the theme *started* with the folder structure of the file (IE /kadence), then it would return true
// This meant that we were getting conflicting values and a lot of errors (it was essentially trying to load the files from Kadence's theme directory, not the child)

/* -- */

// RPECK 16/07/2023 - Redux Embed
// Current redux is embedded in the /vendor folder (redux-core)
// Having thought about it, this should be the correct pattern as it means that the version of redux that ships with the theme is static
// Of course, it's preferrable to update it, but that can be done with new theme releases
